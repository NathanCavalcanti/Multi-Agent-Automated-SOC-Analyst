        "4. DO NOT map T1071 (C2) or T1071.001 (Web Protocols) unless there is evidence of BEACONING or persistent communication.\n"
        "5. DO NOT map T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) unless there is evidence of exploitation (RCE, injection, etc).\n"
        "6. For file downloads, prefer T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer).\n"
        "7. For phishing with malicious links, use T1566.002 only if there is evidence.\n"

Incident description:

{incident_text}

Extracted IOCs (JSON):

{ioc_snippet}

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Only map techniques with DIRECT evidence from the incident
- For downloads: use T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer)
- For ZIP files: use T1560.001 (Archive via Utility) if relevant, NOT T1027.003
- For C2: ONLY if there's evidence of beaconing/persistent communication
- For exploitation: ONLY if there's evidence of RCE, injection, or vulnerability exploitation
- For ransomware execution: focus on T1204 (User Execution), T1059 (Command/Scripting), T1486 (Data Encrypted for Impact)

Return ONLY a valid JSON with the following structure:

{{
  "techniques": [
